### Global AI Night Beginner Track
*Get started quickly with AI with low to no code*


**Part 1: Creating applications that can see, hear, speak or understand - using Microsoft Cognitive Services (1 hour)**

In this workshop you will be introduced to Microsoft Cognitive Services, a range of offerings you can use to infuse AI and machine learning into your applications without needing to build the code from scratch. We will cover pre-trained AI APIs, such as computer vision and text analytics, that are accessed by REST. Then we will look at how you can host these models in containers, giving you the ability to run Cognitive Services offline and on edge devices. Finally we will dive into more custom AI that uses transfer learning, allowing you to provide a small amount of your own data to train an image classification model.
 
 
**Part 2: Would you survive the sinking of the Titanic? How to use Azure Machine Learning Studio to build ML models with no code to predict your survival chances (1 hour)**

For problems that canâ€™t be solved with prebuilt models, Azure Machine Learning Studio is here to save the day! In this workshop we will go over the data science process for building custom machine learning models in Azure Machine Learning Studio. We will cover the data science process from end to end, including cleaning and prepping your data, choosing the right algorithm, testing, deploying and finally consuming the model in your application.  Lastly a brief example of how to build the same model in Python with code.
